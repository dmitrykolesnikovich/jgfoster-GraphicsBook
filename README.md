This repository contains the files used to create David Eck's *Introduction to Computer Graphics*. To build the PDFs and web site, clone this repository, download Xalan [binaries](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xalan/xalan-j) to a new 'xalan/' in this directory (or put a symbolic link in this directory to a directory containing the downloaded .jar files), and then run the BUILD-all.sh script.
